# VirtualTourist
Penultimate project for Udacity Nanodegree.

# Overview
This app downloads and stores images🌉 from Flickr. It allows users to drop pins📍 on a map, as if they were stops on a tour🚍. They will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist those pictures, asociating them with the pin.
